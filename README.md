Kodi App


####The simple way

1. Open chromecast app on your Android phone. Now open the menu and select the “Cast screen/audio”. Follow the instructions for connecting to chromecast.
2. Open Kodi. Find and play the video you want to watch.
3. It will now start playing on both devices, the battery consuming thing here is that you can’t turn off the screen or attend calls etc.


####The long way

1. Download kodi, Es file explorer, localcast and playerfactorycore.
2. Open Es file explorer and navigate to it’s settings then display settings. Make sure that “show hidden files” is selected there.
3. Now also make sure that kodi(formerly XBMC) media center is connected to kodi app.
4. Now navigate to the folder where you downloaded playerfactorycore.xml file and copy it.
5. Go to Android > Data > org.xbmc.kodi > Files > .kodi > here look for userdata folder. Now paste the playerfactorycore.xml file in this folder.
6. Now, open kodi and search for the video which you want to play. It will now automatically launch the localcast app. If it asks to choose from chromecast and localcast, simply select localcast.
7. Once it completes loading, it will asks you to play and choose the device to stream.
Now again it will prompt you to play and finally, your video will start playing on tv connected with chromecast.
